# Advent of Code 2025 solutions

frig made me do this

This repo contains my solutions to [AoC2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), each level on one branch. `main` has just the template for me.

All code is built with the included `CMakeLists.txt` with CMake v3.31.6, Ninja v1.13.1, sccache v0.12.0 and GCC CLI+ABI Clang v21.1.6 on x86-64 architecture (Intel Core i5-11500), Fedora Linux; any attempts to reproduce possibly involved intrinsics/inline asm/controlled UB on incompatible hardware with incompatible software are a certified "works on my machine" moment and is not a problem with the code.
